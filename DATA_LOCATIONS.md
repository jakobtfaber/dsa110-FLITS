# Data Locations for CHIME-DSA Co-Detection Project

**Raw-data authority (2026-07-24):** **h17** (`lxd110h17`) — `/data/Faber2026/data/`. Every raw CHIME/FRB baseband and DSA-110 filterbank used by this project is pulled from h17 and from nowhere else. Full inventory with checksums: Faber2026 `docs/rse/ops/raw-data-provenance.md`; ledger at `h17:/data/Faber2026/provenance/h17-source-data-migration-20260721.json`.

**Processed-data archive (2026-06-26):** Google Drive **jakobtfaber@gmail.com** — `Research/CHIME_DSA_Codetections/` (~280 GiB). This is the bulk store for *derived* products — burst pickles, full-Stokes waterfalls, fit results — not a raw-data access point and not an authority for anything raw.

**Host roles:** jakob-mbp (code), **h17** (raw-data authority + compute), gdrive (processed-data archive), arc/CANFAR (CHIME baseband upstream origin; `.npy` replica). Retired hosts h23, hpcc, dsacamera are read-only quarantine references only. `iacobus` (`iacobus-bkp-mbp`) was the staging source; its tree was drained 2026-07-13 and it is not an access path for anything.

History of the host migration that produced this layout: [`docs/infrastructure/MIGRATION_PLAN_4HOST.md`](docs/infrastructure/MIGRATION_PLAN_4HOST.md) (superseded host-role plan; kept as a record) · Inventory: [`machine_inventory.yaml`](machine_inventory.yaml) · Query: [`scripts/query_machine_inventory.py`](scripts/query_machine_inventory.py) · Upload: [`scripts/migration/iacobus_to_gdrive.sh`](scripts/migration/iacobus_to_gdrive.sh)

## Code (GitHub canonical)

| Host | Path |
|------|------|
| **jakob-mbp** | `~/Developer/repos/github.com/jakobtfaber/dsa110-FLITS` |
| **GitHub** | https://github.com/jakobtfaber/dsa110-FLITS |

Do not develop on hpcc, arc checkout, or h23 trees. h17 may hold an optional clone for docker workflows.

## Raw data (h17 authority)

Raw input for all twelve co-detected bursts:

| Instrument | Path on h17 |
|---|---|
| CHIME/FRB singlebeam baseband | `/data/Faber2026/data/chime-frb/<burst>/singlebeam_<chime_event_id>.h5` |
| DSA-110 filterbank, Stokes I | `/data/Faber2026/data/dsa-110/<burst>/<dsa_observation_id>_dev_polcal_I.fil` |

`/data` is a separate 13 TB volume on h17, not part of its root filesystem — a search rooted at `/` with `-xdev` misses all of it.

Upstream origins, recorded for auditing and **not** access paths: CANFAR `arc:projects/chime_frb/data/chime/baseband/processed/…` for CHIME baseband; `dsa-storage` (`dsa-storage.ovro.pvt`) and `h23` for DSA filterbanks.

Stokes Q, U and V were not migrated — h17 is authoritative for total intensity only. Polarisation work needs the four-Stokes sets staged there first.

Derived `.npy` waterfalls under `h17:/home/ubuntu/flits-runs/data/` are **not** raw data: the dispersion measure is baked into the filename and the array, so they cannot be used to revalidate a dispersion measure.

## Processed data (Google Drive archive)

**Bulk archive, not an authority:** `gdrive-jakob:Research/CHIME_DSA_Codetections/` (rclone remote; account **jakobtfaber@gmail.com**).

| Access | Path |
|--------|------|
| **rclone** | `gdrive-jakob:Research/CHIME_DSA_Codetections/` |
| **Drive for Desktop** | mount after adding jakobtfaber@gmail.com — expected `~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-jakobtfaber@gmail.com/My Drive/Research/CHIME_DSA_Codetections/` |

**Staging source (iacobus) — DRAINED 2026-07-13:** upload complete and verified (`rclone check --size-only`: 0 differences, 5437 matching files; 244.815 GiB / 5438 objects on Drive). The tree was moved (move-only, never `rm`) to `iacobus:~/Research/_quarantine/CHIME_DSA_Codetections-drained-20260713/` with a `PROVENANCE.md`. Upload script remains `scripts/migration/iacobus_to_gdrive.sh` (direct iacobus→Drive; jakob-mbp orchestrates only); closeout in [`docs/infrastructure/HANDOFF_mbp_tailscale_ssh_iacobus.md`](docs/infrastructure/HANDOFF_mbp_tailscale_ssh_iacobus.md).

**Legacy iCloud mirror:** `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Research/CHIME_DSA_Codetections/` — demoted; jakob-mbp shows placeholders only. The gdrive upload is now verified (2026-07-13), so the iacobus CloudDocs clone's retention condition is met — disposal is an owner decision.

| Subdir | Role |
|--------|------|
| `burst_npys/` | DSA/CHIME burst `.npy` (h23 drained 2026-06-25) |
| `burst_pickles/` | 24 full-Stokes `.pkl` (Dropbox → iacobus) |
| `dsa_fullstokes_waterfalls/` | IQUV `.npy` from h23 |
| `scattering_results/` | Fit PDFs, corners (h23 + hpcc JSON merged) |
| `dm_budget/` | DM budget code + h23 merge |
| `metadata/` | CSVs, localizations |
| `presentations/` | DM phase deck/keynote plus `DSA_DM_phase/` per-burst PDFs |
| `archive/` | `OLD_CHIME_DSA_Codetections/`, `dsa110-scat/` |

Sentinels: [`codetections_manifest.yaml`](codetections_manifest.yaml)

**Out of scope:** nihari (`Research/nihari/` on iCloud; h23 `jfaber/nihari/` remains on source).

## CHIME Morphologies (separate project)

**Not part of CHIME–DSA co-detections or the gdrive upload.**

| Host | Path | Size (2026-06-26) |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **iacobus** | `~/Research/CHIME_Morphologies/burstprop_paper/` | 67G |

Moved from `CHIME_DSA_Codetections/archive/burstprop_paper/` on iacobus 2026-06-26. iCloud CloudDocs may still show the old path until mirror sync catches up; authoritative live path is `~/Research/CHIME_Morphologies/`.

### rclone setup (gdrive-jakob)

No Drive remote existed on jakob-mbp or iacobus as of 2026-06-26. One-time OAuth (browser required):

```bash
# jakob-mbp — interactive config
rclone config
# n) New remote → name: gdrive-jakob → Storage: drive → scope: drive
# client_id/secret: blank → advanced: drive.readonly=false
# auto config: y  (opens browser; sign in jakobtfaber@gmail.com)

rclone about gdrive-jakob:
rclone mkdir gdrive-jakob:Research/CHIME_DSA_Codetections   # create canonical root

# Headless iacobus — copy token from jakob-mbp authorize:
rclone authorize "drive"    # jakob-mbp: copy JSON blob
ssh iacobus rclone config   # paste at config_token prompt
```

Verify: `rclone about gdrive-jakob:` · `rclone lsd gdrive-jakob:Research/`

**Note:** jakob-mbp currently mounts **jakobtfaber.caltech@gmail.com** only (`GoogleDrive-jakobtfaber.caltech@gmail.com`); personal account mount is optional after upload.

## Burst `.npy` for fits (arc + local replica)

| Host | Path | Role |
|------|------|------|
| **arc** | `arc:home/jfaber/baseband_morphologies/chime_dsa_codetections/data/DSA_bursts` | CANFAR primary (~2.9G) |
| **arc** | `.../CHIME_bursts` | Separate namespace from iacobus burst_npys |
| **jakob-mbp** | `~/Data/Faber2026/chimefrb/CHIME_bursts` | Current CHIME/FRB full-resolution replica |
| **jakob-mbp** | `~/Data/Faber2026/dsa110/DSA_bursts` | Current DSA-110 full-resolution replica (moved from `~/Developer/dsa110-local-data/DSA_bursts` 2026-06-30) |

Current dual-band producers require both local roots explicitly. They do not
search for CHIME/FRB products under the DSA-110 root.

## Compute workspace (h17)

Distinct from the raw-data root above. `/data/Faber2026/data/` is authoritative raw input; the paths below are working space.

| Path | Size | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `/data/Faber2026/` | ~24G | **Raw-data authority** — see the raw data section above; also holds `evidence/` and `provenance/` |
| `/data/research/astrophysics/frbs/chime-dsa-codetections` | ~72G | Compute + artifact cache (not a git source of truth). Held the raw files before the 2026-07-21 migration; paths into it for raw input are stale |
| `.../dsa110-FLITS/` | clone | Canonical FLITS checkout on h17 (`jakobtfaber/dsa110-FLITS`) |
| `.../upchan_codetections` | ~1.8G | Upchan products (12-target table in baseband_recovery worker) |
| `.../archive/arc_trash_2026-06` | 36G | arc trash copy; optional dedupe → iacobus |
| `.../scripts/h17_codetections/` (in clone) | — | Promoted compute workers (see that README) |

Full layout, promotion rules, and sync commands:
[`docs/infrastructure/H17_WORKSPACE.md`](docs/infrastructure/H17_WORKSPACE.md).

`/data/jfaber/` is empty of codetection products as of 2026-06-27.

## Results library (processed fit products)

**Canonical local inventory (jakob-mbp):** `~/Data/Faber2026/results-library/`  
Override: `FABER2026_RESULTS_LIBRARY`.

| Role | Path |
|------|------|
| Library root | `~/Data/Faber2026/results-library/` |
| Index | `$FABER2026_RESULTS_LIBRARY/INDEX.md` |
| Catalog (git) | sibling analysis repo `../analysis/scripts/results_library_catalog.yaml` |
| Materialize | `python3 ../analysis/scripts/materialize_results_library.py` |

Phase B moves bulk campaign `results/`, `_a1_fits/`, `joint_json/`, and `pipeline/results` into the library; in-repo paths are local symlinks (gitignored). Driver `.py` stays in FLITS / parent `analysis/`. Overleaf `figures/` stay in Faber2026 git (link-only).

Full posteriors / dynesty samples remain under `$FLITS_RUNS` (see compute-scratch), not the results library.

## Legacy Documents-Area Clone

Drain-only snapshot, not active dev:

- `~/Documents/research/caltech/ovro/dsa110/dsa110-FLITS/` (iCloud Areas mirror)
- See [`docs/migration/chime-dsa-documents-area-migration.md`](docs/migration/chime-dsa-documents-area-migration.md)

## Retired hosts (quarantine / read-only)

Move-only policy; restore one-liners in each host's `_quarantine/README.md`.

| Host | Quarantine path | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **h23** | `/media/ubuntu/ssd/_quarantine/jfaber-drain-20260625/` | Partial: archive, burstprop_paper, chime_dsa_codetections (~137G). Residual at `jfaber/`: nihari, tools, dsa110-continuum, frb_inventory, scratch |
| **h23** | `/dataz/dsa110/T3/` | **Not quarantined** — 59T raw pipeline; leave on source |
| **hpcc** | `/home/jfaber/_quarantine/flits-20260625` | Full flits tree quarantined 2026-06-25; JSON artifacts on jakob-mbp |
| **dsacamera** | — | Decommissioned; no codetection content |

## CANFAR arc compute

Storage: `vos`/`vls` with `~/.ssl/cadcproxy.pem`. Compute: `canfar` CLI (`canfar create --gpu N`). Notebook sessions without `--gpu` are CPU-only. Live A100 MIG smoke test passed 2026-06-25.

## Dropbox exit

Authoritative staging on iacobus CloudDocs `Dropbox-Migration/`; codetection-scope folders renamed `*_retired_2026-04-24_iCloud_is_authoritative/` on Dropbox source. Burst pickles live only under `Research/CHIME_DSA_Codetections/burst_pickles/`.
