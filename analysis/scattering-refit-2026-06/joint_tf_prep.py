"""S/N-driven resolution + robust tail-aware on-pulse window for joint CHIME+DSA fits.

Motivation (2026-07 manuscript review). The manuscript joint-fit figures exposed
two undocumented, unstable heuristics in the joint-fit preprocessing:

1. **Window.** ``BurstDataset._crop_on_pulse`` (pipeline/io.py) set the on-pulse
   span to the global ``[min, max]`` of *every* time bin clearing 3-sigma, then
   padded by ``0.5 * span``. A single far off-pulse noise sample above 3-sigma
   blew the window open (DSA/whitney -> 57 ms, 875 samples) while a clean sharp
   burst collapsed it (DSA/isha -> 0.6 ms, 9 samples). Run per band, CHIME and
   DSA landed on wildly different time extents, so the joint figure hatched one
   band across times where the other plainly showed burst signal, and the fit
   likelihood was dominated either by off-pulse baseline (over-wide) or clipped
   the scattering tail (over-narrow). The clipped CHIME window is why e.g.
   whitney's CHIME ``t0`` came back at -5.2 +/- 6.9 ms (unconstrained, outside
   its own 5.5 ms window) while the DSA ``t0`` was +/- 0.0016 ms.

2. **Resolution.** ``f_factor`` / ``t_factor`` were hard-coded per band (CHIME
   64/24, DSA 384/2) regardless of burst brightness, giving peak per-pixel S/N
   from ~5 (oran CHIME: burst lost in noise, over-resolved) to ~95 (freya CHIME:
   structure averaged away, under-resolved). No S/N justification, and casey
   silently diverged at 32/4.

This module replaces both with stated, S/N-driven rules applied identically to
every burst and both bands (no per-burst hand-tuning):

* :func:`robust_onpulse_bounds` -- a peak-anchored, contiguous, hysteresis-tail
  window. The core is grown outward from the profile peak while it stays above a
  high threshold; the trailing edge is then extended down a low threshold to
  capture the scattering tail, with a bounded gap tolerance and an absolute cap
  so an isolated off-pulse spike can neither open the window nor collapse it.

* :func:`choose_resolution` -- the finest ``(t_factor, f_factor)`` whose on-pulse
  S/N clears a fixed floor: the finest binning the burst brightness honestly
  supports. Time binning is refined until the band-integrated profile peak drops
  to the S/N floor; frequency binning keeps the most channels (within a band-count
  cap) whose median on-pulse channel still clears the floor.

Both are consumed by :func:`prepare_band`, a drop-in replacement for the
``prepare`` in ``run_joint_fit.py`` / ``dump_jointmodel.py`` so the FIT and the
FIGURE share one preprocessing. The chosen factors and window are returned as
metadata for the figure captions and the fit log.

# the FINEST binning still meeting this, so a higher floor -> coarser bins. 10 is
# a conservative "structure is real, not noise" bar for the manuscript figures.
# FLITS_SNR_TARGET overrides the floor (opt-in): LOWER it to let a finer f clear
# the per-channel S/N gate, so a bright/clean burst keeps more channels. Used by
