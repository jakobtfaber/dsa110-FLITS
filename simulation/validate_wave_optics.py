    )
    # Actually, let's interpret D parameters consistently.
    # D_mw is distance to first screen.
    # D_host is distance to second screen.
    # D_host_src is distance from second screen to source.
    # We'll calculate z_host=0 for local.
    
    # We need to manually patch the D_host_m interpretation in the class if z=0
    # Because _DA(0,0) is 0. 
    # But WaveOpticsScintillator uses _DA.
    # We should stick to the class logic.
    # If z_host > 0, D_host is large.
    # To mimic a "Toy" 2-screen system, we might need a subclass or just use the z_host logic 
    # but acknowledge we only test the "Strong + Strong" limit.
    
    # Let's keep the original "Gpc" setup but increase simulation box L?
    # No, L=10^22 m is 1 Gpc. We can't simulate a grid that large with 1024 pixels (dx would be MPc).
    # Wave optics requires dx < r0 (approx). 
    # If r0 ~ 1000m, we need 10^20 pixels.
    # IMPOSSIBLE for Gpc simulation with realistic r0.
    
    # Conclusion: Full wave optics simulation of IGM scattering (Gpc) is only possible if
    # the scattering is extremely weak (r0 large) OR if we use "effective" scaled models.
    # Pradeep 2025 likely simulates a "scaled" version or focuses on the diffractive limit near caustics.
    # Given the user says "Extending FLITS... significantly improve accuracy in certain regimes",
    # and "validating geometric approximation", it's likely intended for the regime where it IS feasible.
    # (e.g. Plasma lensing, small D).
    
    # So I will assert the "Toy Model" (Pulsar-like distances) is the correct validation case.
    # To fix "z_host=0" issue, I will just set params such that D_host is calculable.
    # Actually, let's just use z_host=0.000001 (very close).
