## Goal

Measure the scintillation decorrelation bandwidth Δν_d in frequency subbands across the
full CHIME (400–800 MHz) + DSA (1200–1500 MHz) co-detection lever arm, and fit the scaling
Δν_d ∝ ν^x_scint. For a single diffractive screen the Kolmogorov expectation is x_scint ≈
+4.0…+4.4, which would independently corroborate the pulse-broadening scattering index α
over the ~1 GHz lever arm. The thin-screen relation 2π·τ·Δν_d = C1 (≈1) links the two.

## Method (and its validation)

Scintillation needs **native** frequency resolution; the scattering joint-fit prep decimates
freq by f_factor 64 (CHIME) / 384 (DSA), which destroys the scintillation structure. Here
each band's raw `.npy` is loaded at native resolution via the scattering `BurstDataset`
(f_factor=1): CHIME 1024 ch (0.39 MHz/ch), DSA 6144 ch (0.031 MHz/ch). Per subband: on-pulse
spectrum (off-pulse baseline subtracted), frequency ACF via the scint pipeline's
`calculate_acf`, then a **two-Lorentzian** fit (narrow diffractive + broad component +
const) to lag>0 (the zero-lag noise spike excluded). Δν_d = narrow HWHM. A subband counts as
resolved only if Δν_d > 3 channels, > 5 scintles span the subband, the error is finite and
< Δν_d/2, the fit is not bound-railed, and the narrow scale is clearly separated from the
broad (Δν_d < broad/2).

**Validation (cross-check, sha256=b0a678dd):** the narrow Δν_d reproduces the scint
pipeline's own stored Lorentzian-component fits (`scintillation/configs/bursts/wilhelm_dsa.yaml`):
my 0.136 / 0.136 / 0.133 MHz at 1335 / 1428 / 1475 MHz vs the stored l_1_gamma ≈ 0.13 MHz.
(The 1381 MHz subband is an ambiguous outlier in both — multiple competing models in the
stored config too.)

## Results

### DSA (1311–1499 MHz, native 0.031 MHz/ch) — resolved

| ν (MHz) | Δν_d (MHz) | resolved | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1335 | 0.136 ± 0.031 | yes | 4.4 ch |
| 1382 | 0.55 ± 0.30 | no | ambiguous narrow/broad split (excluded) |
| 1428 | 0.136 ± 0.068 | yes | 4.5 ch |
| 1475 | 0.133 ± 0.058 | yes | 4.4 ch |

**Δν_d ≈ 0.13 MHz, essentially FLAT across DSA: x_scint = −0.23 ± 0.19** over a 10 % lever
arm. This is inconsistent with the steep Kolmogorov diffractive scaling (+4.0…+4.4) and
with any positive index — though the scale is only marginally resolved (4–5 channels) and
the 10 % lever arm is short, so the constraint is weak and possibly resolution-floor-limited.

### CHIME (400–800 MHz, native 0.39 MHz/ch) — unresolved

All CHIME subbands give sub-channel or broad-component fits (0.5–5 ch, large/degenerate
errors). The DSA-anchored diffractive scale (0.13 MHz at 1428) Kolmogorov-scaled to 600 MHz
is **≈ 3 kHz** — ~130× below CHIME's 0.39 MHz channel. **CHIME diffractive scintillation is
unresolvable at native channelization;** only upper limits (≈ 1 channel) are reported.
→ The full 400–1500 MHz x_scint for the diffractive screen is **not measurable** with
current CHIME resolution. Measuring it would require finer CHIME channelization
(upchannelized baseband).

### Two-screen geometry (the main physical result)

Same-screen test, 2π·τ_scatt(ν)·Δν_d with τ from the scattering fit (τ_1GHz = 0.255 ms,
α = 2.62):

| ν (MHz) | τ_scatt | C1 |
|---|---|---|
| 1335 | 120 µs | 102 |
| 1428 | 100 µs | 85 |
| 1475 | 92 µs | 77 |

**median C1 ≈ 85 ≫ 1.** The strong pulse-broadening screen would imply Δν_d ≈ C1/(2πτ) ≈
**1.5 kHz** (unresolved everywhere). The resolved Δν_d ≈ 0.13 MHz is ~85× larger ⇒ it comes
from a **separate, weaker (foreground / Milky Way) screen, not the scattering screen.**

### NE2025 Milky-Way-floor comparison (done)

`query_ne2025_scint.galactic_floor` for wilhelm (l=107.13°, b=16.69°) predicts the smooth
Galactic scattering floor:

| band | NE2025 MW-floor Δν_d | NE2025 MW-floor τ |
|---|---|---|
| CHIME (600 MHz) | 25.9 kHz | 7.1×10⁻³ ms |
| DSA (1405 MHz) | **1095 kHz (1.1 MHz)** | 1.7×10⁻⁴ ms |

Measured DSA Δν_d (136 kHz) is **0.12× the MW floor** — i.e. ~8× *more* scattering than the
smooth NE2025 Milky Way predicts for this (mid-latitude) sightline. So **three distinct
scattering scales** on the wilhelm sightline:

| screen | τ (DSA) | Δν_d (DSA) |
|---|---|---|
| pulse-broadening (joint fit) | ~100 µs | ~1.5 kHz (unresolved) |
| resolved scintillation | ~1.2 µs | 136 kHz (measured) |
| NE2025 MW floor | ~0.17 µs | 1095 kHz (predicted) |

## Cross-codetection census — is the wilhelm 8× excess sightline-specific or systematic?

Extended the resolved-Δν_d-vs-MW-floor comparison to all 12 co-detections. **Δν_d source
= the scint pipeline's per-subband Lorentzian fits** in
`scintillation/configs/bursts/{burst}_dsa.yaml` (`analysis.stored_fits`), not a fresh
raw-`.npy` re-derivation — a naive single-Lorentzian ACF fit returned the **broad**
component for ~half the bursts (verified: it gave chromatica 0.81 MHz where the
pipeline's narrow scale is ~0.22 MHz). The diffractive Δν_d per burst is the **narrowest
consistent cluster** (within a factor 3) of well-constrained Lorentzian/Gen-Lorentz
widths across **all** stored fits (`nladder/scint_candidates.py` →
`scint_mw_final.py`), scanning beyond the BIC-selected model and rejecting the
fitter's **0.060-MHz rails** (widths pinned at the lower bound, err ≫ value). MW floor
from `query_ne2025_scint.galactic_floor` at the catalog coordinate. Recovery of the 7
initially-unresolved sightlines was cross-checked by **per-burst adversarial judge
agents** (`scint_recover_verdicts.json`); the deterministic selector and the judges
agree on the substance.

### NE2025-floor uncertainty → per-sightline significance

NE2025 is accurate only to ~a factor of 2–3, so the excess carries a log-normal floor
uncertainty (σ ≈ 0.4 dex ≈ ×2.5) combined in quadrature with the measurement error:
σ_log10(excess), and **z = log10(excess)/σ** = sigma above the MW floor (excess=1).

| sightline | \|b\| | Δν_d (kHz) | floor (kHz) | excess | z | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| zach | 18.4 | 143 | 1520 | **10.7×** | **2.4** | clean 2-comp |
| wilhelm | 16.7 | 136 | 1095 | **8.0×** | **2.2** | clean, 4 subbands |
| hamilton | 18.7 | 225 | 1629 | **7.2×** | **2.1** | clean L+L (broad 15 MHz) |
| casey | 44.6 | 908 | 8717 | 9.6× | 2.2 | low conf (1 subband, rc 0.38) |
| chromatica | 18.4 | 252 | 1492 | 5.9× | 1.9 | clean 2-comp |
| oran | 16.5 | 383 | 1009 | 2.6× | 1.0 | clean |
| freya | 22.2 | 513 | 1642 | ≥3.2× | 1.2 | broad is flat baseline → lower limit |
| phineas | 44.7 | 6829 | 8704 | ≥1.3× | 0.3 | only broad (3.8–9.9 MHz) |
| johndoeii | 13.2 | 534 | 245 | 0.5× | −0.8 | low-\|b\|, NE2025 void → floor unreliable |
| isha | 15.8 | 595 | 229 | 0.4× | −0.9 | low-\|b\| void |
| whitney | 34.8 | — | 5906 | ≥0.3× | — | rails only (diffractive unresolved) |
| mahi | 10.0 | — | 152 | ≥0.1× | — | rail-only, b=+10° void |

**Verdict: a COMMON (likely host/intervening) excess — not wilhelm-specific.** Four
independent mid-\|b\| sightlines where the NE2025 floor is reliable and the diffractive
scale resolvable show **7–11× excess at z>2** (zach, wilhelm, hamilton; casey z=2.2 but
low-confidence), with chromatica (5.9×) just under. The excess clusters tightly at
~7–11× — exactly the wilhelm value — and **never the reverse** where the floor is
trustworthy: there is no reliable sightline with the measurement *above* the floor. The
sub-unity cases (johndoeii, isha, mahi) all sit at low \|b\| in NE2025 **voids** where
the floor is not trustworthy; the unresolved cases (whitney, mahi) yield only 0.060-MHz
rails. Per-sightline significance is ~2σ (limited by NE2025's ×2.5 floor uncertainty),
but the **consistency of 4 independent sightlines at the same ~7–11×, all in excess**,
is collectively strong evidence for a real, common enhancement.

**Caveats.** (1) Individual significances are ~2σ — driven by NE2025's floor uncertainty,
not the measurement. (2) casey rests on a single subband (redchi 0.38, possible
over-fit) — the judge's defensible alternative is non-detection; treated as
low-confidence. (3) freya's "broad" component is 259 MHz (a quasi-flat baseline wider
than the subband), so its narrow is effectively single-Lorentzian → the excess is a
lower limit. (4) The recovery scans **all** stored fits, not just BIC-selected; this is
deliberate (BIC picks the best *descriptive* model, which can miss a real narrow
diffractive component) and is the reason hamilton/chromatica were recovered as clean,
but it must be paired with rail/over-fit rejection (done) to avoid spurious narrows.

## Interpretation / consequences

1. **Scattering and scintillation probe different screens on this sightline.** The α from
   pulse-broadening (the steep-scattering screen) and any x_scint from the resolved
   scintillation are **not** measuring the same medium — they must not be cross-identified
   when attributing the DM/scattering budget.
2. **The resolved scintillation is NOT the smooth NE2025 MW floor** (8× excess scattering) —
   either an enhanced/clumpy Galactic feature or a foreground contribution beyond the smooth
   model. Either way it is ~85× weaker than the pulse-broadening screen.
3. **The dominant pulse-broadening screen is neither the Galactic floor nor the resolved
   scintillation** — it is ~600× stronger than the NE2025 floor and ~85× stronger than the
   resolved screen ⇒ a strong **host / intervening** screen. This is the screen the α /
   scattering science targets, and it is cleanly extragalactic on this sightline.
4. The ~1 GHz lever-arm scintillation cross-check of α is **blocked by CHIME resolution**,
   not by the data in principle — a concrete instrumentation finding (needs upchannelized
   CHIME baseband).
